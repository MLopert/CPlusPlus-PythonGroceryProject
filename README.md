# Cplusplus-Program
#This project was used to go through a text file to find the frequency of repeated words generally and by user input and then display that data in a text-based histogram.
#The format of the histogram is formatted nicely even though it is text-based. It has good readability from a user's perspective. 
#The menu is supposed to loop after each option besides the exit but it breaks after the second option. This is a defect in the code that should be fixed for a better user experience.
#Going through the file and sorting the text using regular expressions was new for me. I had to seek out resources such as StackOverflow and W3Schools to complete this project. 
#Through this project I learned how to properly integrate Python and C++ and the value of using their different capabilities in a single program. This has taught me to look at the option of using more than one language for more projects in the future to avoid their disadvantages. 
#To make this program readable and maintainable I made sure to limit the amount of code in main, provide single-line comments about different functionalities, and organize each capability into its own function.
