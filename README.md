# Cplusplus-Program
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  * This project was used to go through a text file to find the frequency of repeated words generally and by user input and then display that data in a text-based histogram. It successfully utitlized both Python and C++ for this task. From the users perspective, they could control the program through a looped menu.
- What did you do particularly well?
  * The format of the histogram is formatted nicely even though it is text-based. It has good readability from a user's perspective. In my next project, I look forward to exploring the available libraries, such as Matplotlib, that will help me format more histograms.
- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  * The menu is supposed to loop after each option besides the exit but it breaks after the second option. This is a defect in the code that should be fixed for a better user experience. I also hard-coded a value for the maximimum length of a word in the text-file for formatting which should realistically be found within the program, in the event the information in the text-file was to ever change. 
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  * Going through the file and sorting the text using regular expressions was new for me. I had to seek out resources such as StackOverflow and W3Schools to complete this project. These resources have been especially helpful for me throughout this course and expect to continue using them in the future.
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  * Through this project I learned how to properly integrate Python and C++ and the value of using their different capabilities in a single program. This has taught me to look at the option of using more than one language for more projects in the future to avoid their disadvantages. 
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  * To make this program readable and maintainable I made sure to limit the amount of code in main, provide single-line comments about different functionalities, and organize each capability into its own function.
